## Overview  
- **Shusaku** is a Go-playing AI powered by the **Monte Carlo Tree Search** algorithm.  
- It supports automatic self-play between AI agents.  
- After each game, an evaluation graph is displayed for analysis.

## How to Use  
1. Download the latest version of `Shusaku.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/foriver4725/Shusaku/releases/tag/v1.0.0).  
2. Extract the ZIP file and run one of the executables inside `Shusaku > Apps`:  
   - `Shusaku_9x9.exe`  
   - `Shusaku_13x13.exe`  
   - (`19x19` is included but may not run properly on most machines due to hardware limitations.)  
3. Game logs and evaluation data will be saved in the `Shusaku > Outputs` folder.  
   **Please do not modify the directory structure under `Shusaku`!**
