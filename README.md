# Shusaku

## Overview
- This is a `Go AI` using the **Monte Carlo tree search** algorithm.
- Computers automatically match.
- When the match ends, a evaluation graph will be displayed.

## How to use
1. Download the latest `Shusaku.zip` from : [The Latest Release](https://github.com/foriver4725/Shusaku/releases/tag/v1.0.0)
2. Might be flagged as a virus and may not be downloadable. If that happens, we kindly ask for your understanding and request individual support.
3. After download, extract the ZIP file, then run `Shusaku > Apps > Shusaku_NxN.exe`. (There are 9x9, 13x13, and 19x19. 19x19 will not work properly due to hardware limitations.)
